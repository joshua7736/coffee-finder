# Coffee Finder

A small Python CLI to find coffee/cafe places near a location. It prefers Google Places if you set `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` in your environment; otherwise it falls back to OpenStreetMap Overpass queries.

Usage examples

- Use detected location (IP-based):

```bash
python -m coffee_finder
```

- Provide lat,lng:

```bash
python -m coffee_finder --latlng 40.7128,-74.0060 --radius 1200 --limit 10
```

- Provide address (geocoded via Nominatim):

```bash
python -m coffee_finder --address "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA"
```

Google Places

To use Google Places (better ratings), set environment variable `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`.

Install

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notes

- Overpass may return no ratings; Google returns ratings when available.
- Use `--min-rating` to filter results (works only where ratings are present).
